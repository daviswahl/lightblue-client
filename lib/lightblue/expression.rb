  # The Expression class wraps and manipulates the AST for each expression type specified by Lightblue. It is the only class that should
  # operate directly on the AST.
  #
  # There is one expression subclass for each of the primary expressions specified by Lightblue: Query, Projection, Sort, and Update.
  #
  # Expressions are meant to be used in two ways:
  #   - Instantiated directly by the user, so they may be used and reused to compose a larger query or queries.
  #   - Insantiated by the Query/Manager DSLs, which then composes them them into a query. The difference is that the builder/DSL
  #     syntax makes it more difficult to expose the Expression for reuse at a later time.them to build a query.
  #
  # Expressions generally expose methods corresponding to the operators and terminals defined under the Lightblue spec.
  # However, other methods might be useful. These methods must return a new instance of Expression instantiated with the tranformed AST.

    # All of the nodes are currently defined in here. Need to make better use of inheritence.
    # Ideally, a visitor should be able to visit_nary, but currently, it has to visit_nary_(operator)

    # I forsee having a handful of abstract subclasses of node, each with tons and tons of concrete classes
    # that mostly only implement to_s

    # It may also be worth creating abstract Operator and Expression classes, which Operators and Expressions can
    # implement. Either way, we need to define which abstract node classes we expect.
